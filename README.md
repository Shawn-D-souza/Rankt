## **Overview**

Rankt simplifies complex decision-making. Instead of being overwhelmed by a long list of options, this tool allows you to rank them by making a series of simple binary choices. By comparing just two items at a time, you can generate a complete, accurately sorted list that truly reflects your priorities.

It's perfect for ranking project features, choosing a vacation destination, ordering your favorite movies, or anything else you can list\!

## **How It Works**

The process is designed to be as straightforward as possible:

1. **Enter Your Items**: Paste or type your items into the text box, ensuring there is one item per line.  
2. **Start Ranking**: Click the "Start Ranking" button to begin the comparison process.  
3. **Compare Head-to-Head**: Rankt will present you with two items from your list. Simply click on the option you prefer.  
4. **Get Your Results**: Continue making choices until all comparisons are complete. Rankt will then display your final, perfectly ordered list.

## **Features**

* **Simple Text Input**: Easily paste or type any list of items to get started immediately.  
* **Pairwise Comparison Engine**: Leverages a powerful sorting algorithm to break down the ranking process into simple, manageable one-on-one choices.  
* **Clean & Intuitive Interface**: A minimalist UI that keeps you focused on the decision at hand without distractions.  
* **Restart Options**: You can easily **Start Over** to re-rank the same list or begin a **New Ranking** with a completely different set of items.

## **Core Logic**

At its core, Rankt uses a **merge sort algorithm**. This efficient, comparison-based algorithm is what allows the application to rank your list. Each "choice" you make between two items serves as a comparison that informs the algorithm, which then progressively builds the final sorted list.
