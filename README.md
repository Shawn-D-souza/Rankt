## **Overview**

Rankt is a web-based utility designed to bring clarity to decision-making. It enables users to input any list of items—from project priorities to favorite movies—and systematically rank them through customizable comparisons.

Instead of struggling with the overwhelming mental juggling of multiple options, Rankt allows you to make simple, manageable choices that generate a final, accurately ordered list.

## **How It Works**

The process is designed to be as straightforward as possible:

1. **Paste Your List**: Open Rankt and paste or type your items into the provided text box, with one item per line.  
2. **Set Comparison Size**: Choose how many items you want to compare at once. Select pairwise (2), three at a time (3), or a custom number that suits your needs.  
3. **Start Ranking**: Rankt will present you with items from your list according to your chosen comparison size. Simply click on your preferred option in each set.  
4. **Get Your Results**: Once all comparisons are complete, Rankt displays your final, perfectly ordered list. You can then easily copy the list to your clipboard or download it as a .txt file for future use.
